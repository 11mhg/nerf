# NERF

This is a simple implementation of a NERF using Jax. 

I wrote this because I wanted to get a better understanding of how NERF's work and to have my own code to play around with.
Starting from scratch helped me better understand more pieces of the puzzle. 


## How to use

To train run: 
```bash
python3 ./nerf/train.py
```

and to visualize:
```bash
python3 ./nerf/render.py --help
```
